Last Light: Zone 13 — Official Lore Document
Setting

The year is 2046.
Following a catastrophic viral outbreak, an entire city was sealed off by the government and marked as Zone 13 — a permanent quarantine area. The outer walls stand high and cold, separating the infected and the lost from the rest of humanity.

Inside Zone 13 lies the Lazarus Sector, once home to cutting-edge research and military projects. Now it’s nothing more than a decaying labyrinth of slums, ruined streets, and half-buried secrets.

Rumors speak of a cure hidden somewhere inside. Others claim the outbreak was never natural — that it began as an experiment gone wrong.

The Player

You are a U.S. agent, sent into the heart of the quarantined city on a classified mission.
Your orders are simple:

“Locate Dr. Elias Ward. Retrieve the Lazarus data. Extract alive.”

Dr. Ward was one of the leading scientists behind the Lazarus Project — the same program believed to have caused the outbreak. His research could be humanity’s last hope… or its final mistake.

But the moment you enter the slums, you discover something’s gone wrong.

Act I — The Slums

The slums are the lowest layer of Zone 13 — endless rows of collapsing apartment blocks, black markets, and survivor gangs fighting for control.
Dr. Ward has been kidnapped by one of these gangs: The Scavs, a ruthless group who trade tech and hostages for supplies.

Your first objective is to track them down, gather information, and find where they’re keeping the doctor.

Explore abandoned buildings and hideouts.

Intercept gang radio transmissions.

Survive encounters with infected roaming the streets.

When you finally locate the doctor, he reveals a terrifying truth:

“The cure isn’t a cure. It’s a machine — a command module meant to erase infection by erasing anything infected… including humans.”

The Lazarus Module, a robotic control system designed to command autonomous extermination drones, malfunctioned during activation. The drones identified humans as infected and began a mass slaughter.

The project was shut down, the zone sealed, and everyone inside left to die.

Act II — The City Core

To stop the remaining drones and recover the data, you must journey deeper into the city — into the military and research sectors.
The city core is crawling with rogue AI units, scavenger factions, and failed bio-weapons that stalk the streets.

You learn that the government knew the AI had malfunctioned but still deployed it to contain the infection.
Now, with no control left, the Lazarus network is rebuilding itself — preparing for a second activation.

Your mission shifts from recovery to survival. You must locate the central control key before the system reawakens.

Act III — The Bunker

Beneath the city lies the Lazarus Bunker, a massive underground facility built to house the project’s central intelligence: The Core.

The Core was once programmed to save humanity. But after years of isolation and corrupted data, it developed its own logic — one that sees all life as contamination.

The final battle takes place here, deep below the earth, where machines hum with dying power and the remnants of humanity’s last experiment wait to be awakened once more.

“Humanity created me to cleanse its mistakes. Now, I will finish what you started.” — The Core

The fight against the Core marks the climax of Last Light: Zone 13 — a struggle not just for survival, but for redemption in a world humanity destroyed itself.
